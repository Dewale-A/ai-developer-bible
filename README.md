# 📖 The AI Developer Bible: RAG Edition

**A hands-on guide from zero to production-ready RAG systems.**

*By Wale Aderonmu — built while learning, refined through building.*

## Who This Is For

You're transitioning into AI engineering. You have a technical background, you can read code, but the world of LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases is new territory. You want to understand not just *how* to build these systems, but *why* they work the way they do.

This guide is your companion.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Explain RAG architecture to a technical interviewer (or a CEO)
- ✅ Build a production-grade RAG system from scratch
- ✅ Choose the right chunking strategy, embedding model, and vector store for your use case
- ✅ Debug retrieval issues and optimize for relevance
- ✅ Deploy RAG systems with proper observability
- ✅ Answer common interview questions with confidence

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Read sequentially** — Each section builds on the previous
2. **Run the code** — Don't just read, execute and experiment
3. **Break things** — Understanding comes from debugging
4. **Explain it back** — If you can teach it, you know it

---

## The FinanceRAG Project

This guide is built around a real project: **FinanceRAG** — a production-grade RAG system for financial document Q&A.

📁 Project location: `~/workspace/FinanceRAG/`

As we work through each concept, we'll tie it back to actual code you've built.
